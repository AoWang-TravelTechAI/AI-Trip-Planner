# ðŸ“Œ Project Summary: AI Trip Planner

## ðŸ‘¤ Role & Responsibilities
As the **sole developer and project lead**, I designed and built the AI Trip Planner from scratch to demonstrate my transition from **tourism to AI + software development**. I integrated natural language generation, third-party APIs, and a Flask web server to deliver an intelligent and personalized travel planning assistant.

---

## ðŸ§  What I Built
- An **interactive travel itinerary generator** that creates detailed multi-day travel plans based on user input.
- Integration with the **Groq API** using **Mixtral** for fast, high-quality language generation.
- Real-time attraction recommendations via the **Google Maps Places API**.
- A clean and responsive **Flask web UI** that communicates seamlessly with the backend via JavaScript `fetch()`.

---

## ðŸ§ª Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Python** (Flask, API integration, exception handling)
- **JavaScript** (`async/await`, `fetch`, JSON handling)
- **HTML/CSS** (responsive frontend with Bootstrap)
- **RESTful API architecture** & **JSON parsing**
- Secure key management with **`.env` + `.gitignore`**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration
- Debugging using **Chrome DevTools** and **Python logs**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
Manual itinerary planning is time-consuming and often lacks personalization.  
This project allows users to **generate rich, AI-powered plans with one click**, tailored to their **destination** and **travel duration**.

---

## ðŸ’¼ Job Readiness Impact
This project strengthens my resume and job prospects by showing:
- Real-world application of **large language models (LLMs)**
- **Full-stack** development skills (frontend + backend + API)
- My ability to connect **domain expertise (tourism)** with **AI**
- Potential for roles in **travel tech**, **content generation**, and **user-centered AI**
