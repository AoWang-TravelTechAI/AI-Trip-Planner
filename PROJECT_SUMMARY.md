# Project Summary: AI Trip Planner

## ðŸ‘¤ Role & Responsibilities
As the sole developer and project lead, I designed and built the AI Trip Planner from scratch to demonstrate my transition from tourism to AI + software development. I integrated natural language generation, third-party APIs, and a Flask web server to deliver an intelligent and personalized travel planning assistant.

## ðŸ§  What I Built
- An interactive travel itinerary generator that creates detailed multi-day travel plans based on user input.
- Integration with the **Groq API** using **Mixtral** for fast, high-quality language generation.
- Real-time attraction recommendations via **Google Maps Places API**.
- A clean and responsive **Flask web UI** that communicates seamlessly with the backend via JavaScript `fetch`.

## ðŸ§ª Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Python (Flask, API integration, error handling)
- JavaScript (async/await fetch, JSON handling)
- HTML/CSS (clean frontend design with Bootstrap)
- RESTful API architecture and JSON parsing
- Secure key management via `.env` and `.gitignore`
- Version control using Git and GitHub
- Debugging with browser DevTools and Python logs

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
- Manual itinerary planning is time-consuming and lacks personalization.
- My solution allows users to generate rich, AI-powered plans with one click, tailored to specific destinations and durations.

## ðŸ’¼ Job Readiness Impact
This project enhances my resume in multiple dimensions:
- Shows hands-on experience with large language models (LLMs)
- Demonstrates full-stack capabilities (frontend + backend + API)
- Connects my tourism background with real-world AI applications
- Opens up opportunities in travel tech, content generation, and user-centric AI
